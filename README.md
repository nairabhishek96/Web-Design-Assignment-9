# Controllers: 
user.controller.js
Node.js code implements a straightforward authentication system that includes fundamental validation checks. 
The system utilizes the Express framework to create routes and the Mongoose library to connect to a MongoDB database. 

Logintest: This function is called when a user tries to login. 
Validates the email and password entered by the user.
If valid, searches for a user credentialswithin the database. 
If user is found, then it compares the entered password with the hashed password in the db.
If the passwords match, it sends a "Login successful" else sends an "invalid credentials" message.



# Models
user.models.js:

This is a Node.js module defining Mongoose schema for a user object comprising name, email, and password fields. 
It exports two methods & both take a user object and a callback function as input arguments.
- addUser 
- updateUser

# Routes
user.routes.js:

This is an Express.js router module used for managing users in a user management system.
It defines several HTTP routes that map to various user management functions implemented in the user.controller.js module.

- The POST /Logintest route authenticates a user based on their email and password, using the loginuser function in the user.controller.js module.
- The POST /user/create route creates a new user, using the userpost function in the user.controller.js module.
- The GET /user/getAll route retrieves a list of all users, using the getAlluser function in the user.controller.js module.
- The PUT /user/edit route modifies an existing user, using the editusers function in the user.controller.js module.
- The DELETE /user/delete route removes an existing user, using the deleteuser function in the user.controller.js module.


# Services
user.services.js: 

- The code contains several functions for managing users in a web application, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
- The createuser function creates a new user in the database by first checking if the email already exists and then saving the user to the database using the User.addUser method.
- The getusers function retrieves all users from the database using the User.find method and returns them in the response.
- The updateusers function updates an existing user in the database by first checking if the email exists and then updating the user's name and password with the given values using the User.findOneAndUpdate method.
- The removeuser function deletes a user from the database by first checking if the email exists and then deleting the user from the database using the User.delete method.
- The user.controllers file contains the controller functions that interact with the User model, while the user.route file defines the routes that map to these controller functions.
